# Challenge 14 | Belly-Button-Diversity 

For this Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset challenge, we looked at the various microbes that live in our belly buttons.  This is a really gross topic to think about. 

### This Project
We were first asked to create our new repository and download the provided files from our Module 14 Challenge file.  After take a glance at the data, the files were pushed to GitHub.

We were then asked to use D3 to read in our json sample files that came from an amazon aws url.  From the files, we needed to create several displays to show the data.

- A Demographic Data Box

- Bonus - Create a Gauge Chart

The challenge to this assignment was to allow the user to select on the dropdown in the demographic box, select a new sample value and then work to have all of the various plotly plots adjust to visually show the new data.

Having the starting point of the index.html file; along with some of the static code to help get us going, was crucial for my understanding.  Some times the completely blank file is daunting and having the little bit of help, can help my brain to focus on what I need to get done. So I continued to utilize the starter file code and never renamed the files that I was working with.  Coding is easier for me to understand when I can see that the code is going what i want it to do.  So thankfully the console.log function was able to help me ensure that things were working; as I stepped my way through some of it.  

Adjusting some of the styling (colors on the gauge chart) were easy to do.  I feel that it would look nicer if more styling was completed, but that was not a focus of this listen, so I did a little bit.

### Bonus
The bonus gauge chart was really neat once it was working.  It took me several different attempts to understand and it get it to function. I am confident (as I found various examples to study) that didn't do the mathy portion of the gauge chart, but the was a sample that I was able to step myself through to be able to understand how to build it.  But I'm certain that if I tried it again, it would be an equally difficult task to.
