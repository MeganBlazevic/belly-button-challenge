# Challenge | Belly-Button-Dicersity 

For this Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset challenge, we looked at the various microbes that live in our belly buttons.  This is a really gross topic to think about. 

### This Project
We were first asked to create our new repository and download the provided files from our Module 14 Challenge file.  After take a glance at the data, the files were pushed to GitHub.

We were then asked to use D3 to readh in our json files from a amazon aws url.  From the files, we needed to create several displays to show the data.
- Horizontal Bar Chart
- A Bubble Chart
- A Demographic Metadata box
- Bonus - Create a Gauge Chart

The challenge to this assignment was to allow the user to select on the dropdown in the Demographic box, select a new sample value and then work to have all of the various plotly plots adjust to visually show the new data.

Coding is easier for me to understand when I can see that the code is going what i want it to do.  So thankfully the console.log function was able to help me ensure that things were working; as I stepped my way through some of it.  

Adjusting some of the styling (colors on the gauge chart) were easy to do.  I feel that it would look nicer if more styling was completed, but that was not a focus of this listen, so I did a little bit.

### Bonus
The bonus gauge chart was really neat once it was working.  It took me several different attempts to understand and it get it to function. I am confident (as I found various examples to study) that didn't do the mathy portion of the gauge chart, but the was a sample that I was able to step myself through to be able to understand how to build it.  But I'm certain that if I tried it again, it would be an equally difficult task to.
